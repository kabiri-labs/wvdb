## 4) **Event handler attribute** (on\*)
If the value is written into an event handler attribute (e.g., `<div onclick="<HERE>">`), the interpreter treats it as JS.

- **Probe:** `1` → should be treated as a literal string by safe rendering.
- **PoC:** `alert(1)`
- **Safe tell:** The handler is not created from untrusted input; values are not interpolated into `on*` attributes at all.

**Notes:** The fix is architectural—do not bind user input into event attributes. Use addEventListener and data attributes.
