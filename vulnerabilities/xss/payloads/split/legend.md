## Legend
- **Probe:** non-destructive input to confirm reflection/context (ideally produces no execution).
- **PoC:** minimal, readable code execution to prove impact (e.g., `alert(1)`).
- **Safe tell:** what “safe rendering” looks like after fixes (the string is shown literally or safely escaped).
