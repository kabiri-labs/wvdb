## 3) HTML **Attribute** context (unquoted)
Value lands after `=` without surrounding quotes, e.g., `<img alt=<HERE>>`

- **Probe:** ` test` (space) â†’ should be encoded; space must **not** create a new attribute.
- **PoC:** ` onmouseover=alert(1)`
- **Safe tell:** No new attributes; the value is quoted by the template or safely encoded.

**Notes:** Avoid unquoted attributes in templates; they are error-prone.
