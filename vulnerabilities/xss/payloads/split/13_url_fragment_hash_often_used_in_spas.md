## 13) **URL fragment / hash** (often used in SPAs)
If the app reads `location.hash` and writes to DOM:

- **Probe:** `#XSS_TEST`
- **PoC:** `#x=';alert(1);//` â†’ only fires if the app injects into JS string or event attrs.
- **Safe tell:** Hash is parsed safely and rendered via safe APIs with encoding.
