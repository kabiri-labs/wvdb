## # XSS Payloads by Rendering Context (Responsible, PoC-focused)
**Purpose:** quick, context-based payloads for **authorized testing in a sandbox**. This file avoids obfuscated/evasion-heavy lists and focuses on clear, minimal PoCs that help you identify *context* and verify *fixes*.

> Use only with explicit permission. Prefer test tenants. Pair with encode-on-output and CSP hardening guidance in the stories.
