# WebHackFlow

**WebHackFlow** is a community-driven project that captures the **hacker mindset** by documenting how attackers actually think, move, and exploit web vulnerabilities.  
Instead of listing weaknesses in isolation, it tells the **attack story** — showing the flow from reconnaissance to exploitation.

## 🔍 What it’s about
- Focus on **real-world attacker perspectives**.
- Organize vulnerabilities not only by type, but also by the **path attackers take**.
- Provide **attack stories** that explain *why* and *how* vulnerabilities are exploited.

## 📂 Structure
- `xss/` → Cross-Site Scripting attack stories and payloads.  
- `sqli/` → SQL Injection attack scenarios, detection, and payloads.  
- `idor/` → Insecure Direct Object Reference and Broken Access Control flows.  
- More categories to come…

## 🚀 Why WebHackFlow?
While vulnerability databases collect “what exists,” **WebHackFlow** focuses on *“how it happens.”*  
It’s designed for:
- Penetration testers who want to sharpen their attacker mindset.  
- Developers who want to understand how attackers chain vulnerabilities.  
- Learners who prefer stories and flows over static checklists.  

## 🤝 Contribution
